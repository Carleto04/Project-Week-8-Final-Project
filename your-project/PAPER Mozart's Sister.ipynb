    "Did you know that Mozart had a sister? Her name was Marianne and she was also a composer. Some say that she served as an inspiration for him to follow his career path (she was the *older* sister). Now, thanks to machine learning, Mozart's Sister can recommend you songs in Spotify based on the emotions she detects you are experiencing from having a short written conversation with you. \n",

Mozart's Sister can help users feel understood and provide some needed feedback about their mood in a moment when the way to do things is different and we are dealing with new sources of stress."

    "To teach Mozart's Sister how to recognise emotions we have used a dataset with sentences linked to different emotions obtained from the work presented on the paper \"Contextualized Affect Representations for Emotion Recognition\" by Elvis Saravia, Hsien-Chi Toby Liu, Yen-Hao Huang, Junlin Wu, Yi-Shin Chen (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1404/).\n",

    "This dataset is constituted by:\n",
    "- 18K sentences that we have splitted in 16K for model training and 2K for model testing. \n",

    "To train Mozart's Sister we have used a Natural Language Process algorithm called Support Vector Machine (applying multilabel Crammer-Singer, which is a one-vs-rest classification method). This algorithm allows to apply supervised learning methodology. \n",

    "The objective of the Support Vector Machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space (n being the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points and predicts the appropriate label.\n",
    "\n",
    "To feed the data into the algorithm, we first remove the noise from the sentences. We achieve this by using the regular expressions module to remove unwanted characters like spaces and symbols, as well as stopwords and stemming. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then isolate the words relevant to the emotions through tokenization and translate them into a language that Mozart's Sister can understand through vectorization. What happens in this step is the following:\n",
    "- Each word is turned into a feature \n",
    "- Each sentence is assigned to the different features\n",
    "- Finally, the emotion detection is trained based on the number of occurrences of each feature and its proximity to each emotion depending on the context set by the sentence"

Once the user confirms their emotion, Mozart's Sister connects to the Spotify API (Spotipy) with the instruction and recommends a track that matches that emotion. \n",
